Hello, my name is Emma and today we will talk about, suggest and recommend. What do these words mean? Well, suggest and recommend have the same meaning in English. Both mean that we use suggest or recommend. When one person wants to tell someone else what they should do. We use suggest and recommend to give advice. Many learners of English make mistakes. With these words, let's look at an example of these mistakes. A common mistake is. Can you suggest me? Can you suggest me a good movie and notice I put an X because eh, it's a mistake I will tell you. Why in a moment? We can see the same mistake with recommend. Can you recommend me a good English teacher? Again, this is a mistake. Eh, why is it a mistake? Well, we do not use me after suggest. We do not use me after recommend. What do we use after these words? Well, there's four different possibilities, and in this video we will look at each possible ending. We can use after suggest or recommend. So I have here 4 sentences to show you what I mean. The first sentence our teacher recommends that we read books. I can also say our teacher suggests that we read books. O1 ending. After suggest or recommend is a that clause. You will often see the word that after suggest or recommend. And we will talk about that in a moment. Another possible ending is we can say our teacher recommends books to us or our teacher suggests books to us. So I wrote the word here books, but we can use a noun or a noun phrase after recommend and suggest. I will explain this in a moment. The third example that we can have. That follows suggest or recommend is ING verbs so we can have the word recommend or suggest. And the very next word is an ING verb. So our teacher recommends reading books. Our teacher suggests reading books. And the final thing that can follow, suggest or recommend the final end of the sentence can be AWH question word. So that can be who, what, where, why, when and how. So an example of this is our teacher recommends what books to read.
大家好，我叫 Emma，今天我们将讨论 suggest 和 recommend。这些词是什么意思？suggest 和 recommend 在英语中含义相同。两者都意味着我们使用 suggest 或 recommend。当一个人想告诉别人他们应该做什么时。我们用 suggest 和 recommend 来给出建议。许多英语学习者都会犯错误。对于这些词，让我们看一个这些错误的例子。一个常见的错误是。Can you suggest me? Can you recommend me a good movie 注意我打了 X 因为嗯，这是一个错误 我会告诉你。为什么稍后？我们可以看到 recommend 也有同样的错误。Can you recommend me a good English teacher? 同样，这是一个错误。嗯，为什么这是一个错误？suggest 后不使用 me。comme 后不使用 me。这些词后用什么？有四种不同的可能性，在本视频中，我们将研究每一种可能的结尾。我们可以在 suggest 或 recommend 后使用。所以我这里有 4 个句子来向你们展示我的意思。第一句话是老师建议我们读书。我还可以说我们的老师建议我们读书。O1 结尾。在 suggest 或 recommend 之后是一个 that 从句。你经常会在 suggest 或 recommend 之后看到 that 这个词。我们稍后会讨论这个。另一种可能的结尾是，我们可以说我们的老师向我们推荐书籍或我们的老师向我们建议书籍。所以我在这里写了 books 这个词，但是我们可以在 recommend 和 suggest 之后使用名词或名词短语。我稍后会解释这一点。我们可以得到的第三个例子。跟在 suggest 或 recommend 后面的是 ING 动词，所以我们可以有单词 recommend 或 suggest。下一个词是 ING 动词。所以我们的老师建议读书。我们的老师建议读书。句子结尾后面可以跟的最后一个词是 AWH 疑问词。所以那可以是谁、什么、哪里、为什么、何时和如何。一个例子就是我们的老师推荐读什么书。

Or we can say our teacher suggests what books to read. So you'll notice, recommend and suggest are often interchangeable. This means they have a similar meaning and we can use them both in the same way. So let's look at examples for each of these endings and talk a little bit more about each one. All right, so let's look at our first example of what can follow suggest or recommend. So I have U here the word that and a clause. So the word that often follows recommend or suggest. You might ask what is a clause? Well, the main. Point of a clause is you have a subject and a verb in a clause. So you will have the word that a subject like I, you, ** *** they, we, and then a verb after that O. We'll look at this in a little more detail. Here is an example sentence. I suggest that. You So this is our subject. Bring. That's our verb, a coat. I suggest that you bring a coat. We can also use the same structure with the word recommend. I recommend that. She study. So one thing you will notice is we use subject pronouns here. So we use words like she. We do not use words like her or him. We use a subject pronoun, which is ** *** I. So that's something to keep in mind. Here is another example. I suggest. He create a resume, but wait, where is that? Shouldn't there be a that there? Well, that's a great question. That is something we can put in, but it's optional. So sometimes in especially in informal language, we won't even include the word that it's your choice. So that's why I have that in brackets. Sometimes we include it, but it's not necessary. So if we wanted to look at this like a mathematical equation, we could say we have our subject, in this case I we have our word suggest or recommend here. So I can just write that in suggest. Or recommend. That which I mentioned is optional. And then we have our person word, which is our subject pronoun I, you, ** *** they, we and then a base verb. So what do I mean by base verb? Well, a base verb means that there is no conjugation. For example, bring. I could say I bring you bring he, bring she, bring. Notice we don't do anything to the verb. It's just. The base form, it's the same here we have she study.
或者我们可以说老师建议读什么书。所以你会注意到，recommend 和 suggest 经常可以互换。这意味着它们具有相似的含义，我们可以以相同的方式使用它们。所以让我们看看这些结尾的例子，并对每个结尾进行更深入的讨论。好吧，让我们看看第一个例子，看看什么可以跟在 suggest 或 suggest 后面。所以我这里有单词 that 和一个从句。所以单词 that 经常跟在 recommend 或 suggest 后面。你可能会问什么是从句？嗯，主要的。从句的要点是在从句中有一个主语和一个动词。所以你会有单词 that 一个主语，比如我，你，他们，我们，然后在那个后面有一个动词 O。我们将更详细地看一下这一点。这是一个例句。我建议。你所以这是我们的主语。带。那是我们的动词，一件外套。我建议你带一件外套。我们也可以使用相同的结构和单词 recommend。我建议。她学习。你会注意到，我们在这里使用主语代词。所以我们使用像她这样的词。我们不使用像她或他这样的词。我们使用主语代词，即 ** *** I。所以这是需要记住的一点。这是另一个例子。我建议。他创建一份简历，但等等，那在哪里？那里不应该有一个那个吗？嗯，这是一个很好的问题。我们可以把它放进去，但它是可选的。所以有时，特别是在非正式语言中，我们甚至不会包括“这是你的选择”这个词。这就是为什么我用括号括起来。有时我们会把它包括进去，但这不是必要的。所以如果我们想把它看作一个数学等式，我们可以说我们有主语，在这种情况下，我们有建议或推荐的词。所以我可以把它写在建议或推荐中。我提到的是可选的。然后我们有我们的人称词，也就是我们的主语代词我、你、** *** 他们、我们，然后是一个基本动词。那么我所说的基本动词是什么意思呢？基本动词意味着没有变位。例如，bring。我可以说我带你带他，带她带。注意，我们没有对动词做任何事情。只是。基本形式，这里我们学习她。
 
 
We don't need to change the verb here. So let's look at some more examples. I suggest that he take our quiz. I've highlighted this because you'll notice there's no S when we use a base verb form. In this case, with suggest or recommend, you do not need to have an S. For he or she Ronouns. Let's look at another example. They suggest that. So here we can put a subject word. In this case I'm going to put the word I. They suggest that I go and again go is in the base form, so this is one ending we can use when we are talking about the word suggest or recommend. We can use that and a clause afterwards. All right, time for a quick quiz. I have here a sentence with suggest and I have. Different possible endings O Let's choose the correct ending. I suggest that. So what comes next? Do we use she or do we use her in this case? So remember the second part is almost like its own sentence. So we would use the word she. So I'm going to circle that she. And remember what I said about the verb. What verb form do we use when we have suggest that or recommend that? Do we say go the base form or goes where we conjugate? In this case, we would use the base form. We would use go. So we would say I suggest that she go, I suggest that she go to the mall. I recommend that she go to the mall. So the beautiful part about suggest and recommend is after that we don't need to conjugate the verb. All right, well, so now let's look at the next example of what can follow, recommend or suggest O This is an easy example. After suggest or recommend, we can have an ING verb. So let's look at an example of this I suggest. Study. In English. So my verb here is study and I add ING. Why? Because after recommend or suggest we use ING verbs, I suggest studying English. Here's an example with recommend. I recommend so we have our verb BI. Recommend being careful online. So again we have our ING. Let's look at an or.
这里我们不需要改变动词。所以让我们看更多的例子。 我建议他参加我们的测验。我之所以突出显示这一点，是因为你会注意到当我们使用基本动词形式时没有 S。在这种情况下，对于 suggest 或 recommend，你不需要有 S。对于 he 或 she Ronouns。让我们看另一个例子。他们建议。所以在这里我们可以放一个主语词。在这种情况下，我要放单词 I。他们建议我去，而且 go 也是基本形式，所以这是我们在谈论 suggest 或 recommend 这个词时可以使用的一个结尾。我们可以在之后使用 that 和从句。好了，现在是快速测验时间。我这里有一个包含 suggest 和 I have 的句子。不同的可能结尾 O 让我们选择正确的结尾。我建议。那么接下来是什么？我们在这种情况下使用 she 还是 her？请记住，第二部分几乎就像它自己的句子。所以我们会使用 she 这个词。所以我要圈出 she。还记得我说过关于动词的话吗？当我们有 suggest that 或 recommend that 时，我们使用什么动词形式？我们是说 go 基本形式还是 goes where 进行变位？在这种情况下，我们将使用基本形式。我们将使用 go。所以我们会说 I suggest that she go，I suggest that she go to the mall。I recommend that she go to the mall。因此，suggest 和 recommend 的妙处在于，之后我们不需要对动词进行变位。好吧，现在让我们看下一个例子，看看后面可以跟上推荐或建议什么。这是一个简单的例子。在 suggest 或 recommend 之后，我们可以有一个 ING 动词。因此，让我们看一个例子，I suggest. Study。在英语中。所以我的动词是 study，我添加了 ING。为什么？因为在 recommend 或 suggest 之后我们使用 ING 动词，I suggest studying English。这是一个带有推荐的例子。I recommend，所以我们有动词 BI。Recommended being caution online。所以我们再次有了 ING。让我们看一个 or。
 
 
 
Actually, before we get to the next example, I should mention that when we use a verb with ING, you'll notice that we don't have a person here. We don't mention the person, we're only mentioning the action. In this case, you know who the person is based on the context, so I suggest studying English. The person likely is. I'm suggesting that to you based off of this context. So let's look at another example and this time I want you to try it. My friend recommends and I have the verb here, take breaks. My friend recommends take breaks. So what do I need to do to this verb? If you said add ING, you are correct. So we can say my friend recommends taking. So take plus ING breaks. So I'll just write that in here taking. Brakes. I recommend getting a new marker. All right, well, let's look at the next example. She suggests. She she suggests. And then we have here our verb spend time in nature. So what do we need to do to the verb? If you said add ING, you are correct. He suggests spending time in nature. OK, another quiz. True or false we use. Me, him, her and them after suggest that or after recommend that. So for example I suggest that me go to the store. I suggest that him study English. I recommend that her learn English. So is this true or false? If you said false, you are correct. We do not use me, him, her or them with suggest that we use I, she, he, we, they after suggest that. All right, well, so now let's look at the third. The third piece that might follow suggest or recommend. Suggest and recommend can be followed by a noun or a noun phrase. So a noun is a person, a place. A thing or an idea and a noun phrase is where you have maybe the word the plus a noun, a + a noun, or maybe a number like 2 + a noun. So let's look at some examples of this. So again, a noun or a noun phrase can come after the word suggest or recommend. Here's my first example. Can you suggest a good restaurant? In this case, we have the word. Good restaurant. That's a noun phrase, and that can come right after suggest. We can also use the same thing with recommend, can you? Recommend a good hotel? Can you recommend a place to buy a coat? Can you recommend a good movie? So these are all examples of a noun phrase. So you might be wondering, should I put the word me here? Can you recommend me a nice hotel? What happens if you want to recommend something to a person? Where do you put the the pronoun or the person word? Do you put it before the noun, right after, recommend or suggest? Or do you put it after? If you said after, you're correct, but we need to use the word to as well. So nothing goes here we can say can you recommend? Well, sorry, we should have the word Can you recommend a nice hotel? To me. O If you wanted to use me that's fine, but it has to come at the end with the word to Can you suggest a good restaurant to me? Can you suggest a nice place to go? To my parents. So the key here is you need the word to and it comes at the end. And then you can have your object pronoun or your person word.
实际上，在我们进入下一个示例之前，我应该提到，当我们使用带有 ING 的动词时，你会注意到这里没有人。我们没有提到人，我们只提到了动作。在这种情况下，你根据上下文知道这个人是谁，所以我建议学习英语。这个人很可能是。我根据这个上下文向你提出这个建议。那么让我们看另一个例子，这次我想让你尝试一下。我的朋友建议，我这里有动词，休息一下。我的朋友建议休息一下。那么我需要对这个动词做什么？如果你说加 ING，你是对的。所以我们可以说我的朋友建议服用。所以 take 加上 ING 休息。所以我就在这里写上taking。刹车。我建议买一支新记号笔。好吧，让我们看下一个例子。她建议。她她建议。然后我们这里有动词花时间在大自然中。那么我们需要对动词做什么？如果你说加 ING，那你就对了。他建议花时间在大自然中。好的，再做一个测验。我们在 suggest that 或 recommend that 之后使用 Me、him、her 和 them。例如，我建议我去商店。我建议他学习英语。我建议她学习英语。这是对还是错？如果你说错了，那你就对了。我们在 suggest that 之后不会使用 me、him、her 或 them，我们在 suggest that 之后使用 I、she、he、we、they。好的，现在让我们看第三个。第三个部分可能跟在 suggest 或 recommend 之后。Suggest 和 recommend 后面可以跟名词或名词短语。名词是人、地方、事物或想法，名词短语中可能会有单词 the 加名词、a + 名词，或者数字，比如 2 + 名词。让我们看一些例子。同样，名词或名词短语可以跟在单词 suggest 或 recommend 后面。这是我的第一个例子。你能推荐一家好餐馆吗？在这种情况下，我们有这个词。好餐馆。这是一个名词短语，可以紧跟在建议之后。我们也可以使用相同的词来推荐，你可以吗？推荐一家好酒店吗？你能推荐一个买外套的地方吗？你能推荐一部好电影吗？所以这些都是名词短语的例子。所以你可能会想，我应该在这里放我这个词吗？你能推荐我一家不错的酒店吗？如果你想向某人推荐某样东西，会发生什么？你把代词或人称词放在哪里？你把它放在名词之前，紧跟在推荐或建议之后？还是放在后面？如果你说在之后，你是对的，但我们也需要使用这个词。所以这里什么都没有，我们可以说你能推荐吗？好吧，抱歉，我们应该有这个词你能推荐一家不错的酒店吗？对我。O 如果你想用我，那没问题，但它必须放在最后，和这个词在一起你能给我推荐一家好餐馆吗？你能推荐一个好去处吗？给我父母。所以这里的关键是你需要“to”这个词，它位于末尾。然后你可以使用宾语代词或人称词。
 
 
All right, what time is it? It's time for another quiz. So I have here the sentence. Can you recommend? A movie. Now I want to put the word me here. How can I do this? Should I say can you recommend me a movie? Or should I say can you recommend a movie? To me which is correct? If you said. To me. You are correct. So we do not have the word me here. It does not follow recommend. It does not follow suggest. If we want the word me in the sentence, it comes at the end after the noun. The noun is the movie, so it comes after that and we need the preposition to. We can put other words here. If we are talking about a man, we can say. Can you recommend? A movie to him? Can you recommend a movie to her? Can you recommend a movie to them? So with the word 2 we can use him, her, me. These are these are some examples of what we can use with that. All right, well, so now let's look at the final item that can follow, suggest or recommend. So so far we've covered that with a clause. We have covered nouns, and we have covered the verb ING. All of these can follow the word suggest or recommend. The final item that can follow suggest or recommend are WH question words and how. So we can use WH questions. What do these include? Where, what, when, why? Who and also how? Which is considered AWH question word even though. It does not start with WH O. Let's look at some examples of this. So the first one could you suggest? So we have our word here suggest and notice the next word is a question word. Could you suggest where I might buy a coat? Could you? Recommend where I might. Find some tasty cuisine. So again, suggest recommend. We can use them in the same way they can be followed by a question word. Here's another example. Can anyone suggest how we should decorate our house? Can anyone recommend how we should decorate? Our Christmas tree. So again, we have our question word how, and you'll notice that right after how or where or these question words, we have a subject pronoun. So that's like words like I, you, ** *** they, we. OK. So those are the four items that follow our words, recommend, and suggest. O what are you going to do now? The best thing to do is to study and to test yourself. We learn a lot by testing ourselves. So here is my recommendation. I recommend that you take our quiz. Where is our quiz? Well, it's at www.com. There you can take a quiz on what you've just learned about, suggest and recommend. I suggest that you subscribe to our YouTube channel. We have a lot of great grammar lessons, a lot of.

好的，现在几点了？该进行另一次测验了。所以我这里有一个句子。你能推荐一部电影吗？现在我想在这里放上单词 me。我该怎么做呢？我应该说你能推荐我一部电影吗？还是我应该说你能推荐一部电影吗？对我而言哪个是正确的？如果你说。对我而言。你是对的。所以这里没有单词 me。它不在推荐之后。它也不位于建议之后。如果我们想要在句子中使用单词 me，它位于名词之后。名词是电影，所以它位于其后，我们需要介词 to。我们可以在这里放其他单词。如果我们谈论的是一个男人，我们可以说。你能推荐一部电影给他吗？你能推荐她一部电影吗？你能推荐他们一部电影吗？所以对于单词 2，我们可以使用 him、her、me。这些是一些我们可以与 that 一起使用的例子。好的，那么现在让我们看看可以跟在、建议或推荐之后的最后一项。到目前为止，我们已经用从句介绍了这一点。我们已经介绍了名词，也介绍了动词 ING。所有这些都可以跟在单词 suggest 或 recommend 后面。可以跟在 suggest 或 recommend 后面的最后一个词是 WH 疑问词和 how。所以我们可以使用 WH 疑问词。这些包括什么？哪里、什么、什么时候、为什么？谁和 how？尽管它被认为是 AWH 疑问词。它不以 WH O 开头。让我们看一些例子。第一个是 could you suggest？所以我们这里有单词 suggest，注意下一个单词是疑问词。Could you suggest where I might buy a coat？Could you？Recommended where I might。Find some tasty cuisine。所以再次，suggest recommend。我们可以像它们后面跟疑问词一样使用它们。这是另一个例子。有人能建议我们应该如何装饰我们的房子吗？有人能建议我们应该如何装饰吗？我们的圣诞树。所以再次，我们有疑问词 how，你会注意到，在 how 或 where 或这些疑问词之后，我们有一个主语代词。就像我、你、他们、我们这样的词。好的。这些是跟在我们单词后面的四个词，推荐和建议。哦，你现在要做什么？最好的办法是学习和测试自己。我们通过测试自己学到了很多东西。所以这是我的建议。我建议你参加我们的测验。我们的测验在哪里？嗯，它在 www.com。在那里，你可以对你刚刚学到的、建议和推荐的内容进行测验。我建议你订阅我们的 YouTube 频道。我们有很多很棒的语法课程，很多。很多很棒的信息，包括关于如何学习英语的技巧和窍门，所以我建议你看看。非常感谢你的收看，下次见，保重。
